    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Accompanying the global trend in the use of bicycles as a sustainable transport, Madrid is not an exception. Its sharing public system (Bicimad) has been growing considerably year by year in terms of users and uses. One of the main goals of the system is to attract those people who travel in private vehicles for internal displacements in the city and thereby reduce negative consequences of car travel such as pollution, noise, etc. To achieve these goals, one of the most important aspects to be considered is the correct location of bike stations in order to satisfy the demand that could exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "While there are many factors to consider to establish an optimal system (exceeding this example), a **good starting point** is to understand how the bicycle network works today and which are either more or less influential stations of the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is difficult to understand with the provided data how important each station is and how it affects the rest of the network. In order to get results, we thought it would be useful to represent data in graphs as is already used in multiple scenarios. \n",
    "\n",
    "Represent and organize data as graphs is really useful when you are trying to define relationships between different nodes and edges. The nodes or vertices are the entities which must be represented, while the edges or arcs define the relationships between those nodes. This type of data works very well for the analysis of social networks and implementation of algorithms such as PageRank to better understand and analyze the relationships between entities.\n",
    "\n",
    "More use cases of data organized in graphs could be social networks, the articles' quality and importance in bibliographic sites and the classification of web sites.\n",
    "\n",
    "**In this example, the implementation of the PageRank algorithm will be applied to Bicimad system**, using public data provided by the company to determine the influence of the nodes in the network. In this case, the nodes will be represented by the stations and each movement or trip will be represented by an arc connecting both stations. The weight of the arc is defined as the number of trips between stations, which will create a directed graph.\n"

    "### Setting up\n",
    "\n",
    "Data used for this example was obtained from public information sources, using the open data services provided by the EMT (Link) system and data for the period between April 2017 and January 2019.\n",
    "\n",
    "We mainly used 2 data sources:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Stations ([Link](https://rbdata.emtmadrid.es:8443/BiciMad/get_stations/WEB.SERV.gaston@gutrade.io/1326B978-2486-479C-B76E-15C4838F9345/))**\n",
    "From each of the stations (172), the id, the name and other characteristics are stored in the *stations.csv* file that will be used later.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Movements or trips ([Source](http://opendata.emtmadrid.es/Datos-estaticos/Datos-generales-(1)))**\n",
    "In this case the information is related to the movements of bicycles. Understanding as movement, the travel of a bicycle from an origin station to a destination station. This information includes data related to the movement itself (departure station, destination) and data relating to the user who performs the movement. It also distinguishes between movements made by the users of the system and movements made by the workers whose job is to cover the demand in certain stations.\n",
    "The ETL process involved the transformation of the original files into a manipulable format, cleaning and deleting some records as:\n",
    "• Records with coordinates outside the limits of Madrid.\n",
    "• Non-existent stations.\n",
    "• Negative travel times\n",
    "\n",
    "There are approximately 7 million trips stored for the indicated period in *movements.csv*"
