# Basic Visualization example using Folium maps and Madrid's bike public system data (Bicimad)

This repo contains the source code and jupyter notebooks with some basic examples about maps visualization (using Folium) and other useful information about Madrid's bike public system.

**Part 1** is about visualization of most frequent bike routes in folium maps using GeoSpatial data.

**Part 2** is about the usage of PageRank algorithm to identify the relevance of bike stations and Louvain to identify communities.

**Part 3** is about identifying patterns on bike's movements between zones and most important stations depending on day time.
