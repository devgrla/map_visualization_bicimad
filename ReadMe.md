# Basic Visualization example using Folium maps and Madrid's bike public system data (Bicimad)

This repo contains the source code and jupyter notebooks with some basic examples about maps visualization (using Folium) and other useful information about Madrid's bike public system.

**Part 1** covers how to transform geolocalization points in LineStrings in order to make it easier to show bike routes in folium maps.

**Part 2** is about the usage of PageRank algorithm to identify the relevance of bike stations.

In **Part 3** we use some circle markers in maps to visualize bike's movements between zones and we identify top stations depending on day time.
